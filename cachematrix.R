## Calculates an inverse of the matrix and caches the result. 
#  So that the next time when the function is called it checks if the output is already available
#  If "yes" it outputs cached result or calculates the inverse of the matrix 
## functions do

## 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
